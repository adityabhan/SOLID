# Single Responsibility

The <strong>Single Responsibility</strong> principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one responsibility.

In the non_ideal.py <br/>

All the functionalities are associated with Animal class.

In ideal.py <br/>

A separate class named AnimalSound is responsible for sound of an animal. Thus helping in achieving single responsibility.
