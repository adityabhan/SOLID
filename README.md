SOLID Principles

The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

## SOLID stands for:

S : Single Responsibility <br/>
O : Open-Closed <br/>
L : Liskov Substitution <br/>
I : Interface Segregation <br/>
D : Dependency Inversion <br/>

## Structure of this repo

Each principle is explained in its respective directory and a directory contains an Ideal and Non-Ideal scenario.

For example:
S - (Single Responsibility) directory

Contains <strong>not_ideal.py</strong> to show the voilation of the principle.
And <strong>ideal.py</strong> tries to follow the principle.
